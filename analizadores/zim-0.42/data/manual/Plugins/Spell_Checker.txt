====== Spell Checker ======

This plugin adds inline spell checking for zim. It has a preference setting to determine the language used for spell checking. If this is not set, the system default is used.

**Dependencies:** This plugin requires the "gtkspell" library to be installed as well as the Python language bindings for this library. On Ubuntu or Debian systems installing the package "python-gnome2-extras" will meet these dependencies.
