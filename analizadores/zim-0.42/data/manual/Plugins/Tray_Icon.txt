====== Tray Icon ======

The Tray Icon plugin adds an icon for zim in the system tray or status bar. This icon gives quick access to the zim notebooks.

Clicking on the tray icon with the left mouse will popup the current notebook if only one notebook is open, or show a menu of notebooks to choose from. If any notebooks are open this menu only contains the open notebooks.

Clicking in the tray icon with the right mouse button will open a menu with all known notebooks. Also there is an option to quit zim entirely.

When the notebook plugin is enabled windows are hidden when they are closed instead of closing them entirely.  Quiting a notebook will really close it. However even when all the windows have quit there is still a zim process running in the background. Select "Quit" in the tray icon menu is the only way to completely exit zim.

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies if you use gtk+ version 2.10 or newer. It is not available for older releases.
